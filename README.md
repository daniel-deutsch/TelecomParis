Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Daniel, I attended TÃ©lÃ©com Paris in 2020/2021.

I created this repository to share with you some of the projects that I did while following the TSIA (Signal Processing for Artificial Intelligence) and MODS-DATA (Markets, 
Organizations, Data, Strategies) filiÃ¨res.

Hope it helps some lost students haha
